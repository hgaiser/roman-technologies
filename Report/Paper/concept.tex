The actual production of a robot that can fully support people with Activities of Daily Living(ADL)\footnote{basic tasks of everyday life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring}  tasks was a too large assignment for the minor time period. The project was narrowed down to providing working fetch-and-carry functionality; a suitable interaction method for interacting with humans. The way these were implemented are based on the full concept of Eva. This concept is presented below.

Eva should be a service robot that performs activities of daily living, designed for making elderly more self-
sufficient\cite{Forlizzi} and home-care professionals more efficient in their distribution of time across clients. These 
activities are based on the tasks of helper dogs that have a proven efficiency on the reduction of the need for 
professional healthcare help\cite{Diepenhorst}. Eva improves the service of helper dogs by allowing 
expansion into ``care at distance'' \cite{Evers} through digital means and by allowing the improvement of the tasks 
performed by an ADLdog. Also an ADLdog has to be taken care of itself, while a robot does not.

Because humans communicate affectively with each other, and often do so with technology, to facilitate interacting with Eva she should give affective feedback. At the very least, she should be able to detect positive and negative feedback with regards to her behaviour, as well as communicate to the user in a clear way that she will adapt her behaviour or understood a command from the user.

Eva should learn actively and passively. The method mentioned before is passive learning. With passive learning Eva 
improves her behaviour directly after the accomplishment of her tasks. This is achieved by having the user give positive 
feedback on ``bringing coffee (a specific drink)''  when the original command was ``get me a (random) drink''.  Eva will 
then slowly change her behaviour in such a way that she will learn to ignore other potential drinks â€“ and in the end will 
only bring coffee when asked for drinks. Using the same method of passive learning, she could also learn to bring coffee 
only in the morning or in the afternoon.

\label{sec:Concept}
Active learning is the second learning form. For active learning one could imagine Eva learning new objects so 
she can help the user with personal items that are not available in the library of objects that Eva does recognize. 
For this form of learning the user should actively interact with Eva, showing her new items, locations, etc. Eva should 
learn actively by combining the ``task'' with the ``object''. An example: the task ``get'' is always known, but it will 
result in an active learning process if the object is unknown. If the object is known, Eva simply performs the task and 
retrieves the object. The same can be done for other tasks involving for instance locations instead of objects.
