We experienced this project as very educational, since we did not only learn a lot about other disciplines, but also a lot about our own discipline. Also, because of the interdisciplinary touch to this project, we were able to deliver good results. However, improvements can be made if more time and money is made available to develop a robot such as Eva. In overall, everyone is happy with the way this project was organized.
