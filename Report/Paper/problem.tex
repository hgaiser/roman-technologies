Home care professionals spend a lot of time on trivial tasks, such as fetching and bringing around objects, instead of spending quality time with the elderly. With the growing rate of elderly in the Netherlands\cite{CBS}, home care professionals have to divide their time over more clients. A robot could take over the trivial tasks to provide humans with more time to spend on a personal level with their clients. This paper focuses on the design of a robot prototype called Eva. The prototype was built with less than \EUR{7500} and in 5 months, which shows that it is feasible to develop a low-budget robot in a short amount of time.
