Home care professionals spend a lot of time on trivial tasks. Instead of spending quality time with the elderly, they have to do tasks such as preparing drinks and food. With the growing rate of elderly in the Netherlands[\cite{CBS}], home care professionals have to divide their time over more clients. A robot could take over the trivial tasks to provide humans with more time to spend on a personal level with their clients.
This paper focuses on the design of a robot prototype that is autonomously able to support people in the domestic health care sector.
