Eva performs her fetch and carry scenario as expected. However, there are limitations on the amount of change in the environment where Eva operates. All findings show that Eva operates correctly in some situations with the correct parameters. However, if one of the parameters changes, the performance of Eva will deteriorate. For instance, if Eva is driving on a carpet instead of on a wooden floor, then she will slip more, making her drive inaccurate. Another example is that Eva cannot distinguish multiple faces when a lot of people stand around her, or that she cannot recognize the command well if ambient noice is present. When these limitations are surpassed issues can occur like the ones described in \pageref{simulation} . 

The most important change to be made to the prototype, in order to use Eva in the health care, is to stabilize Eva\textquotesingle s performance under different circumstances. Also, Eva should be able to perform more tasks other than fetch and carry tasks, so she can be of great help to her owner. We consider Eva as proof -despite of the many improvements to be made, that robots can be used in the near future in the health care section.
