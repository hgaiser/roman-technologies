The test to validate the working of Eva can be categorized as a ``fetch and carry'' test. To start, a person calls for Eva to get her attention. Then the person asks her to bring a drink. When Eva has processed the voice commands, she navigates to the table where the drink is located. At the table Eva searches for the desired object and tries to grab it. When she cannot see the object, she will turn her head to right and left to see if the object is present. If she does find the object at an angle, she will turn her body towards it and proceed the process. She will try three times to grab the object. Finally, she navigates back to the person to hand over the drink if she got it, otherwise she will return sad. After this, the user is able to give Eva feedback. During this process Eva will at her turn respond with her own emotions.

The emotion set has also been tested with children. The idea is that if children understand what emotion Eva is trying to communicate, then it is a successful emotion. Without any prior information, the tester was asked to look Eva in the face and judge what emotion she was conveying.
