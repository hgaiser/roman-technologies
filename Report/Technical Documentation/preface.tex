This report is written for the Minor Robotics WB-MI-168-11 at the Technical University of Delft. For this project, we were provided a mobile base and an underactuated gripper developed at the Technical University of Delft. For this project, a prototype of a homecare robot was made (named Eva), which is able to carry out simple fetch and carry tasks at command and respond with simple emotive expressions. This document describes the technical specifications of Eva and serves as an addition to the actual paper regarding Eva.

We would like to thank the following people for their help during our project:
