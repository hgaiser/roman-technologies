This report is written for the Minor Robotics WB-MI-168-11 at the Technical University of Delft. For this project, we were provided a mobile base and an underactuated gripper developed at the Technical University of Delft. A prototype of a homecare robot was developed (named Eva), which is able to carry out simple fetch and carry tasks at command and respond with simple emotive expressions.
